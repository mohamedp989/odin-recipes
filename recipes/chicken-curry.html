            <b>What Is Indian Chicken Curry?</b><br/>
            Chicken curry from the Indian subcontinent typically features chicken stewed in a tomato-based sauce seasoned with aromatic spices. This recipe, like many others, calls for curry powder (a spice blend made with coriander, turmeric, cumin, and chili powder).
